This is my version of the Robocup SSL project.

The goal for this project is to create an AI that controls 6 robots in order to win a soccer game.

You will need to install grSim: https://github.com/mani-monaj/grSim

Normally, the code is sent to real live robots, but for testing purposes grSim is used to simulate how the robots would behave.
